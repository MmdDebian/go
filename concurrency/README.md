# Concurrency


Large programs are often made up of many smaller sub-programs .

For example a web server handles requests made from web browsers up HTML web pages in response , Each request is handles like a small program . 


It world be idea for programs like these to be able to run their smaller components at the same time (in the case of the web server to handle multiple requests) .
